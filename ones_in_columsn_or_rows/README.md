This was asked by Crowdstrike:

Given a 2D array of 0's and 1's. 

If a column has at least one 1, make the entire column 1's. Same for the rows as well. 


0 0 1 0
0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0
1 0 0 0


Should become: 

1 1 1 1
1 0 1 0
1 0 1 0
1 1 1 1

Because Rows 1 and 4 have 1's in them and Columns 1 and 3 have 1's in them
