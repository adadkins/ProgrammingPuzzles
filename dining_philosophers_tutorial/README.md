There are N philosophers sitting around a circular table, each with a plate of spaghetti and a fork on either side of them. The philosophers spend their time thinking and eating. However, in order to eat, a philosopher needs to hold both forks next to them. The forks are shared resources, and so only one philosopher can hold each fork at a time.

The puzzle is to come up with a solution to allow the philosophers to eat without causing any deadlocks (where no philosopher can proceed) or any starvation (where a philosopher never gets to eat).
