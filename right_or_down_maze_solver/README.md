// Problem Statement
// We need to navigate through an m x n grid, starting at the top-left and exiting at the bottom-right. We can only move either down or right at any point in order to get to the finish. Additionally, certain grid entries can be blocked, as shown in the table below.

// How many unique paths exist?

// (Start)
// (Blocked)
// (Finish)
// Example
// Input:
// [
//   [0,0,0],
//   [0,1,0],
//   [0,0,0]
// ]
// ​
// Expected Output: 2
// ​
// Explanation:
// There is one obstacle in the middle of the 3x3 grid above.
// There are two ways to reach the bottom-right corner:
// 1. Right -> Right -> Down -> Down
// 2. Down -> Down -> Right -> Right
// To execute Go code, please declare a func main() in a package "main"
